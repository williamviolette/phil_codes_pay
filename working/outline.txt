Question : 
	
	Why do companies tolerate non-payment of bills?

	- BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS

	- consumption smoothing

		- income/savings shock:

			Pre-policy: - don't pay bill
						- use same water
			Post-policy: 
						- pay bill
						- use less water


DESCRIPTIVES ! :

	- do the poor pay less frequently?
	- do they use less water when they are threatened with TCD? 
		- (or at higher levels of ar?)




	- exogenous variation in income/savings (uncorrelated with water demand)

		- match with CBMS!
